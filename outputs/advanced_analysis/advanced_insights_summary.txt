ADVANCED THREE-WAY ANALYSIS INSIGHTS
===================================

STRONGEST CROSS-DOMAIN CORRELATIONS:
• Food-Work: Entries ↔ Entries: 0.917
• Food-Work: Count ↔ Entries: 0.915
• Food-Work: Types ↔ Entries: 0.894
• Food-Work: Count ↔ Count: 0.869
• Food-Work: Count ↔ Diversity: 0.865
• Food-Work: Ratio ↔ Entries: 0.860
• Food-Work: Count ↔ Entries: 0.851
• Food-Work: Count ↔ Entries: 0.845
• Food-Work: Count ↔ Count: 0.842
• Food-Work: Count ↔ Diversity: 0.841

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Food-Work Synchronization: Strong correlation (0.917) indicates coordinated tracking behavior
2. Multi-dimensional Relationships: 3D analysis reveals complex interdependencies
3. Temporal Patterns: Rolling correlations show evolving relationships over time
4. Statistical Validation: Manual regression and PCA confirm robust patterns

ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:
• Leverage strong Food-Work correlation for integrated lifestyle optimization
• Monitor temporal correlation changes for early pattern detection
• Use multi-dimensional approach for holistic health assessment
• Continue systematic tracking across all three domains

VISUALIZATION OUTPUTS:
- 3D scatter plots showing multi-dimensional relationships
- Correlation network analysis with node positioning
- Statistical validation through manual regression analysis
- Rolling correlation analysis for temporal patterns
- Manual PCA-like dimensionality reduction
- Advanced correlation matrices with significance testing
